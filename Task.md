Project Idea: Task Management Application
Name of Project: TaskFlow

Description:
Create a task management application where users can sign up, log in, and manage their tasks. Users should be able to create, update, and delete tasks, set due dates, and mark tasks as complete. The application should have features such as authentication, user-specific task management, and real-time updates.

Technologies to Use:
- Front-end: React.js or a similar JavaScript framework/library
- Back-end: Node.js with Express.js or a similar framework
- Database: MongoDB for storing user information and tasks
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication for user authentication and token-based authentication for API calls
- Real-time updates: Socket.io or a similar library for real-time task updates

Key Features:
1. User Authentication: Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication. Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.

2. Task Management: Allow users to create, update, and delete tasks. Each task should have a title, description, due date, and status (completed or not).

3. User-specific Tasks: Ensure that each user can only view and manage their own tasks. Implement the necessary backend logic to associate tasks with the logged-in user.

4. Real-time Updates: Use Socket.io or a similar library to provide real-time updates to users when a task is created, updated, or deleted. This ensures that users see changes to their task list immediately without needing to refresh the page.

5. Task Filtering and Sorting: Add functionality to filter and sort tasks based on different criteria such as due date, status, or priority. Provide user-friendly options to quickly find and manage tasks.

6. Responsive UI: Create a responsive and intuitive user interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

7. Error Handling: Implement appropriate error handling for authentication failures, task creation errors, and other potential issues. Display error messages to users when necessary.

8. Testing: Write unit tests for critical backend functionality and perform integration testing to ensure all components work together smoothly.

Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks and plan your development process accordingly. This project will help you gain experience in building a full-stack application, handling user authentication, managing data with a database, and implementing real-time updates. Good luck with your project!
